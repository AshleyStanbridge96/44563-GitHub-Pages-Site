- Toaster

## Ingredients
- Eggs (You choose how many)
- Bacon or sausage
- Pancake mix (From a box, we are not making it from scratch)
- Bread
- Salt and pepper for seasoning
- Milk (optional)

The most important part of any breakfast is undeniably the eggs. The exciting part about making eggs is the different ways to cook them. Here are a list of different ways to cook some delicious eggs:
1. Scrambled
2. Sunny-side up
3. Hard boiled
4. Omelet style

And the list goes on. In this README, we will focus on how to make scrambled eggs, simply because it is the most common and traditional way.

### Prepping Food
We will start by getting everything prepped before we turn on the stove. First get your kitchen bowl, fork, eggs, seasoning, and milk (optional). Crack however many eggs you desire into the kitchen bowl, then use your fork to whisk the eggs. Once the eggs are whisked, add a generous amount of salt and pepper and mix again. If you have milk and would like your eggs to be a little creamy, go ahead and add a tablespoon of milk to the mixed eggs and whisk again.

After prepping the eggs, make sure your bacon or sausage is out and ready to go, along with your pancake mix. Follow the directions on the box of your pancake mix to get that prepped. Place your bread into the toaster so it is ready to be toasted when the time comes.

### Let's Cook!
Now that everything is prepped, let's begin cooking! Sometimes when cooking breakfast, certain foods will take longer to cook while others cook relatively fast. To avoid having a breakfast of mixed hot and cold food, we need to have good timing.

How do we achieve good timing? Well, let's get familiar with our foods! Scrambled eggs take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes to cook, this will depend on the level of heat and how "done" you would like your eggs. Bacon or sausage takes around 10 minutes. Pancakes surprisingly take the least amount of time clocking in at 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side for a total of 2 to 3 minutes. Lastly, there's toast, which depending on how crisp you would like the toast to be, could take anywhere from 1 to 8 minutes (please do not eat 8 minute toast, that is disgusting). 

Now that we have the timing down, we will finally begin cooking! First, place all 3 cooking pans on the stove. Set one to medium heat (for pancakes), set one to medium-high heat (for bacon or sausage), and set one to medium heat (for eggs). When the desired temperatures are met, take your eggs and pour them into the designated pan (NOTE: If you do not have a non-stick pan, please use butter or oil to make sure the eggs do not stick to the pan). Let the eggs warm up before stirring. 

While the eggs are cooking, start cooking your bacon or sausage. Both are fairly simple, for bacon, flip the bacon strips once the sizzling of the grease comes to a whisper. Repeat this process until the desired crispiness of bacon is achieved. For sausage, whether it is a patty or link sausage, flip it over after a few minutes of cooking until a nice golden brown color is seen throughout.

The eggs should be warm and ready to stir. Once the stirring happens for scrambled eggs, the process of cooking them goes very fast, so keep an eye on your eggs! The preferred method is to stir the eggs in the pan then let them cook/rest for a minute or 30 seconds then stir again and repeat the process. 

When the eggs appear to be firm, this is a sign that they are almost done cooking. When you see this happening, keep a close eye on the eggs as you do not want to overcook them. At this time, the bacon or sausage should be done, turn off the stove top for that pan and place the meat on a paper towel then place another paper towel on top of it so the excess is grease is soaked up. Check on your eggs! If they are firm, turn off the stove top and take them away from heat.

Now that the eggs and bacon/sausage is cooked, we will focus on the pancakes, or in this case, a single pancake. You may cook more than one pancake if you wish, but this README will only talk about the cooking of one. Take your pancake batter and place it in the hot pan and wait to flip every 1 to 1 1/2 minutes until each side is golden brown. When you start the pancake(s), start toasting your bread.
